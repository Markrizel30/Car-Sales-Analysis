Purpose:

The objective of this car sales analysis is to identify the leading brands in the automobile industry, analyze customer behavior and preferences when purchasing a car, and determine which brand holds the highest resale value. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into market dynamics and consumer choices to support strategic decision-making.

Questions:

What manufacturer has the most number of sales and highest product turnover?

What car brand has the highest resale value?

What are the customer's prefer car specs when it comes to buying cars?



Answers:

The analysis of sales volume and value reveals that Ford, Dodge, and Toyota dominate the market, despite their pricing being above the industry average when compared to their competitors.

In terms of depreciation rates, Acura, Porsche, and Honda exhibit the highest levels of depreciation, which consequently results in higher resale values compared to other brands.

Furthermore, the data suggests that car buyers seldom reference specifications, which are the sole data points available in this analysis, as indicated by the scatterplots. This finding implies that customers prioritize factors such as affordability, brand reputation, and historical performance over technical specifications when making purchasing decisions.



Scatterplots Analysis:



Performance: 

•	The relationships generally suggest that sales are concentrated in cars with moderate fuel capacities, efficiencies, and horsepower.

•	High horsepower and high Power Performance Factor values tend to correlate with lower sales, indicating consumer preference for more practical, cost-efficient options over high-performance ones.



Exterior Details:

•	There are weak positive correlations between Length, Width, and Wheelbase with sales quantity, suggesting that slightly larger cars might sell better.

•	Curb Weight appears to have no significant impact on sales.

•	The general takeaway is that moderate dimensions in length, width, and wheelbase align with higher sales, reflecting consumer preference for balanced vehicle sizes.
